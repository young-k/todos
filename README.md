# todos
A simple todo-list tracker, written in `Vimscript`.

I was a power-user of [Todoist](http://todoist.com) for a year, but wanted more customizability, so I wrote a simple plugin to track my TODOs.

More features coming soon.

## Demo

![Demo](https://github.com/young-k/todos/raw/master/demo/demo.gif)

## Installation

If you're using Pathogen, add this line to your `.vimrc`:

```
Plugin 'young-k/todos'
```

and run `:PluginInstall`.


## Usage

Files that end with `.todo` are considered todo-list files.
